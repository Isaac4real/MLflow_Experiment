#### MLflow Lab Part 1: Tracking Module
         
The goal of this example is to show how easy and straightforward it is to implement MLflow 
Tracking to a standard ML model.

**Simple steps to convert a ML model to MLflow:**
1. Import the required MLflow packages
2. Use MLflow Automatic Logging to log every metric and parameter of the model.
3. Iniciate the training model with `mlflow.start_run` to start logging.
