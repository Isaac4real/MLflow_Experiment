### Motivation
If you are a Machine Learning engineer (or similar), you probably know the struggles of
developing the best machine learning service or platform that meets the requirements of
 both your data science and software engineering teams. Maybe you have probably even heard 
 of MLflow before but never actually used it. If that is the case, this series is right for you! 

### What you will learn
* How to **implement MLflow in your current model**, 
step by step and the easiest way possible!

* How to keep **track** of your models, parameters, metrics and code;

* How to **containerize** your projects and models;

* How to **register** and **deploy** your models;

* How to use MLflow UI.
